  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/lang/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: GESS
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/gess/GESS_Bold.otf
         - asset: assets/fonts/gess/GESS_Light.otf
         - asset: assets/fonts/gess/GESS_Two_Bold.otf
    #         style: italic
     - family: NUMBER
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/number_font.ttf
     - family: DROID
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/droid-sans-arabic.ttf
     - family: kARTIKA
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/kartika.ttf
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
